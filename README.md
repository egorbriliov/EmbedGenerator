  By inviting @afilia to your Discord server or logging into our afilia's community server, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and accepted these terms. You are also responsible for informing members of your Discord server of these terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or adding any version of @afilia to your server.
Disclaimer
You are strictly prohibited from using @afilia contrary to ToS Discord or for illegal purposes. We do our best to prevent these activities while trying to provide the best possible user experience. If you find people or communities using @afilia contrary to ToS Discord or even for illegal purposes, please send us a message (‚Å†‚Å†üì©ÔΩúhelp).
Proprietary Rights
We (@afilia owners) own and reserve all rights to the public data (including, but not limited to, templates). We give you permission to use this available data for your own needs, but strictly prohibit any commercial use. Therefore, you must not sell, license, or otherwise commercialize the data unless permission has been expressly granted to you.
Availability
‚Ä¢ Affiliation is provided as is. There is no guarantee that it will be available in the future, and its purpose or availability may change at any time.
‚Ä¢ User data, including backups, may be deleted at any time.
‚Ä¢ User data, including backups, cannot be transferred between Discord accounts.
‚Ä¢ Any premium or paid features are not guaranteed. They may be changed or canceled at any time.
‚Ä¢ Access to all or individual @afilia features can be revoked for all or a specific user at any time.
Refund Policy
Refunds can be made at the user's request and if one of the following requirements is met:
‚Ä¢ it's the first payment and the user requests a refund on the same day
‚Ä¢ it's a monthly recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a three-day period
‚Ä¢ it's an annual recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a seven-day period
‚Ä¢ A major premium or paid feature was removed, and the user bought the tier specifically because of that feature

We still require a clear explanation of the situation and will never guarantee a refund. Partial refunds may be issued for annual payments under special circumstances. Refunds will never be issued if you have violated our Terms of Service and therefore lost access to certain or all features.
